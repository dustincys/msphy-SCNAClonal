# msphy-SCNAClonal

## Introduction

msphy-SCNAClonal is a SCNA's subclonal reconstruction pipeline based on
multi-stage tree structure learning, which could infer the tree structure of tumor's
evolution process from various kinds of sequencing data from a tumor's multiple
samples, such as multiple samples' NGS data obtained at different time points,
or, multiple NGS/Target sequencing/Single cell sequencing or their combination
data.
